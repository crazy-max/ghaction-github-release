## Usage

### Limit releases to pushes to tags

Typically, usage of this action involves adding a step to a build that is gated
pushes to git tags. You may find `step.if` field helpful in accomplishing this
as it maximizes the reuse value of your workflow for non-tag pushes.

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      -
        name: Release
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-release@v2
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
```

You can also use push config tag filter:

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      -
        name: Release
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-release@v2
```

### Uploading release assets

You can configure a number of options for your GitHub release and all are
optional.

A common case for GitHub releases is to upload your binary after its been
validated and packaged. Use the `with.files` input to declare a
newline-delimited list of glob expressions matching the files you wish to
upload to GitHub releases. If you'd like you can just list the files by name
directly.

Below is an example of uploading a single asset named `release.txt`

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      -
        name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > release.txt
      -
        name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      -
        name: Release
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-release@v2
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          files: release.txt
```

Below is an example of uploading more than one asset with a GitHub release:

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      -
        name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > release.txt
      -
        name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      -
        name: Release
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-release@v2
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          files: |
            release.txt
            LICENSE
```

> **Warning**
>
> Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above. That lets you effectively declare a
> multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)

### External release notes

Many systems exist that can help generate release notes for you. This action
supports loading release notes from a path in your repository's build to allow
for the flexibility of using any changelog generator for your releases,
including a human.

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      -
        name: Generate Changelog
        run: echo "# Good things have arrived" > ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
      -
        name: Release
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-release@v2
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        with:
          body_path: ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
          # note you'll typically need to create a personal access token
          # with permissions to create releases in the other repo
          token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        env:
          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: my_gh_org/my_gh_repo
```
